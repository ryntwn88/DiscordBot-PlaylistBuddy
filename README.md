# DiscordBot-PlaylistBuddy
Discord Bot that will scrape a channel for YouTube and Spotify links, then add them to separate playlists for each service.

During the pandemic lockdown in 2020 my friends were sharing a lot of links to music on YouTube and Spotify in our Discord server.  This Bot was built in order to update shared playlists and provide a more convenient experience for listening to all the songs folks were sharing.

The script in this repository is a template to demonstrate how I approached the task.  If you wish to use the code you will need to fill in the keys for various API services (Discord, Spotify, and YouTube) and specify the playlists on each service you want to update.  I know that the code here is not the most pretty or efficient (I am still learning) and would welcome suggestions for improvements.
